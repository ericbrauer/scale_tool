GUITAR SCALE TOOL

This project is a tool to help inexperienced (and lazy experienced!) musicians to map the fretboards of their stringed instruments.

More importantly, however, this is a project that I'm using to entertain myself and become familiar with some of the libraries that Python uses to draw simple graphics and simple UI.
And also, prop up my knowledge of music theory!

As much as possible, I wish to implement a structure as laid out in Julien Danjou's "Hacker's Guide to Python."
This means implementing unit tests, and a nice setup.py and all that fancy jazz.

ROADMAP
-build a module
        return a simple major SCALE
        return a simple minor SCALE
        implement some unit tests to verify these methods
        implement a main.py that inherits module
        get args to select scale
        implement a lot more scales

-display results
        use a graphics tool to draw a bass fretboard (because I'm a bassist :)
        implement a GUI to select between guitar and bass fretboards
        map the previous module onto the fretboards
        implement different tunings onto the fretboards

-web app, because of course
        look into DJANGO as an option to turn this into a web app. Because I didn't bring my laptop to practice :)
