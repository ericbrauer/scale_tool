##GUITAR SCALE TOOL##

This project is a tool to help inexperienced (and lazy experienced!) musicians to map the fretboards of their stringed instruments.

More importantly, however, this is a project that I'm using to entertain myself and become familiar with some of the libraries that Python uses to draw simple graphics and simple UI.
And also, prop up my knowledge of music theory!

As much as possible, I wish to implement a structure as laid out in Julien Danjou's "Hacker's Guide to Python."
This means implementing unit tests, and a nice setup.py and all that fancy jazz.

####ROADMAP####
- build a module
    - [x]    return a simple major SCALE
    - [x]    return a simple minor SCALE
    - [ ]    implement some unit tests to verify these methods
    - [x]    implement a main.py that inherits module
    - [x]    get args to select scale
    - [x]    implement a lot more scales

- display results
    - [ ]    use a graphics tool to draw a bass fretboard (because I'm a bassist :)
    - [ ]    implement a GUI to select between guitar and bass fretboards
    - [ ]    map the previous module onto the fretboards
    - [ ]    implement different tunings onto the fretboards
